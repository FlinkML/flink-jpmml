# flink-jpmml 

Welcome! `flink-jpmml` is a fresh-made library for **Real-Time** machine learning predictions built on top of 
[PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-3/GeneralStructure.html) standard models and [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) 
streaming engine.

`flink-jpmml`is ease to use, running at **serious** scale, backend **independent** and naturally shaped to streaming 
scenario.

## Prerequisites 

In order to getting started, you only need
* any well-known version of a PMML model (**3.2** or above)
* flink-jpmml is tested with the latest Flink (i.e. 1.3.1), but any working Apache Flink version 
([repo](https://github.com/apache/flink)) should work properly.

## Adding `flink-jpmml` dependency
* if you employ sbt add the following dependecy to your project:
    * Snapshot: `"io.radicalbit" %% "flink-jpmml-scala" % "0.6.0-SNAPSHOT"`
    * Stable: `"io.radicalbit" %% "flink-jpmml-scala" % "0.5.1"`

* For [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) users instead:
    * Snapshot
    ```
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.radicalbit</groupId>
            <artifactId>flink-jpmml-scala</artifactId>
            <version>0.6.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```
    * Stable:
    ```
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.radicalbit</groupId>
            <artifactId>flink-jpmml-scala</artifactId>
            <version>0.5.1</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```


Eventually, you can publish `flink-jpmml` on your local repository. Then 

1. execute within the flink-jpmml root
```
> sbt
```
2. select flink-jpmml-scala project
```
> project flink-jpmml-scala
```
3. publish the library to your local repo
```
> publishLocal
```

Keep in mind you will need also Flink `scala-core` `flink-streaming` and `flink-clients` libraries.

Lets start.

## Getting Started 

`flink-jpmml` enables Flink users to execute real-time predictions based on machine learning models trained by any 
system supporting the PMML
standard; this allows efficient streaming model serving along with the **powerful** Flink engine features.

Lets start with a concrete example.

Supposing you have your focused `InputStream` and you want to score related data
```
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.scala._

case class InputEvent(data: Array)

val env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment
val events: DataStream[InputEvent] = env.yourInputStream
```

So you can achieve it easily with the following
```
// This will be all that you need
import io.radicalbit.flink.pmml.scala._

import org.apache.flink.ml.math.Vector
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.scala._


object FlinkJpmmlExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    // your model can reside in any Flink supported backend
    val pathToPmml = "/even/to/distributed/systems"

    val env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment
    val events = env.yourInputStream

    //  a lazy reader implementation
    val reader = ModelReader(pathToPmml)

    // lets go with predictions
    events.evaluate(reader) { (event, model) =>
      // FlinkML Vector abstraction is used
      val toBePredicted = vectorize(event)

      // and here we are
      val prediction: Prediction = model.predict(toBePredicted)
      val result = prediction.value

      // finally custom returns
      (event, result)
    }

    env.execute("Awesome predictions with flink-jpmml")
  }
}


```

Some useful insights from the code:
- in order to load the PMML model, you need to specify only the PMML source path
- `ModelReader` is a lazy reader and it provides the right reading abstraction to TaskManagers
- The resulting `PMMLModel` will be **loaded by once** factory for each TaskManager running on your architecture at 
_construction time_
- the `PmmlModel.predict` method expects Flink Vectors as input event and, if you want to manage NaNs, an optional 
replace value;
- `Prediction` provides the result of the input event evaluation against the PMML model as a `Prediction[Double]` ADT, 
so if the model can't manage a prediction it will return a `EmptyPrediction` value.

`flink-jpmml` provides also a quick prediction function if it can run against a Stream of Flink Vectors

```
...
val vectorStream: DataStream[Vector] = events.map(event => vectorize(event))
val predictions: DataStream[Prediction, Vector] = vectorStream.evaluate(reader)

predictions.map(_.target).print()

env.execute("flink-jpmml quick predictions")
```

These really basic examples show you how to interact with the library. The following sections try to address some 
interesting details which worth a deeper analysis.

## Behind the scenes 
`flink-jpmml` main effort is to retain all the streaming concepts:

- since Flink is able to run against several **distributed backend**, users need to specify only the PMML source path: 
the library will take care how to load the model in full compliance of the underlying distributed system 
(e.g. HDFS, Alluxio)
- `ModelReader` is the object implementing the previous behavior; it will provide the loading methods but will read it 
_lazily_, _i.e._ only when the transformation will be applied
- The `PMMLModel` will be loaded by a singleton model factory for each TaskManager running on your architecture; that means if you have an
active TaskManager _A_ made up of 4 TaskSlots, your TM will load the model from a single loader entity; this is 
crucial in order to let the system scale in thread-safety (still simple PMML models can grow to several hundreds of MegaBytes 
proportionally to the model size, meaning a big load in memory terms)
- the `PmmlModel.predict` method expects Flink Vectors as input events; this choice let us to leverage the underlying 
Breeze implementation and **no reflection** will be applied at all; moreover, the user don't have to specify any 
key-value structure: you have data matching a feature vector, so the former will be used against the latter; 
(see [input discussion](#input-abstraction) section for further details)
- `flink-jpmml` can also handle sparse data, thus you can just pass the desired _replace value_ as argument to the 
discussed method (here you will need a SparseVector) ```val prediction = model.predict(sparseData, replaceValue)```
- `Prediction` is the output case class: it returns the result of the input event evaluation against the PMML model as 
a `Score[Double]` ADT, so if the model can't manage a prediction it will return a `EmptyScore`.

 The design worths bit more focus: the choice to have a UDF as input prediction method is justified by the need of 
 handling a Machine Learning task (a prediction task) along with a pure Streaming application; in this way the user can 
 manage predictions in the body of the function with the primitive event.

## Input Vectors Abstraction 
<a name="input-abstraction"></a>

Assume this is the considered PMML feature vector
```
["sepal_width", "sepal_length", "petal_width", "petal_length"]
```
and you have values for all these fields; so, just create a DenseVector
```
val vector: DenseVector = DenseVector(value1, value2, value3, value4)
```
Suppose you missed value2, so you will need a SparseVector

```
val vector: SparseVector = SparseVector(4, Array(0, 2, 3), Array(value1, value2, value4))
```

`flink-jpmml` will recognize missing values and it will replace them with `replaceValue` if specified
(as second argument of the `PmmlModel.predict` method), otherwise the NaNs handling is demanded to the PMML model.

Note also `flink-jpmml` assumes that if you employ a DenseVector, it means that the dense instance size is your model 
size and it will not predict anything (i.e. returns `Score.Empty`); in case of sparse instances, 
the library reads the sparse size value.


## How `flink-jpmml` handles prediction issues 

`flink-jpmml` won't break your job if something goes wrong but the model loading step; it is such a crucial
action (it's mandatory for predictions), then in case of failure it raises a `ModelLoadingException`. 
Each other issue is detailed as log messages. 

The handled failures are:
- _Input Validation failure_ - The input is not corresponding to the feature vector in size terms (either too big or 
too short)
- _Input Preparation failure_ - JPMML library fails to prepare internal data format
- _Evaluation step failure_ - JPMML fails to evaluate the input against the PMML
- _JPMML Result Extraction failure_ - The job fails to retrieve the result from the PMML model
